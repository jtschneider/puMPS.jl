Based on code originally developed by Yijian Zou and published in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 230402 (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.230402) also to be found open access at [arXiv:1710.05397](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05397).

* Ground states of local Hamiltonians (currently specified as MPOs)
* Bloch-state (tangent-space) excitations
